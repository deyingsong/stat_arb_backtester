DEPLOYMENT DECISION
======================================================================

RECOMMENDATION: DO NOT DEPLOY ✗

The strategy likely suffers from overfitting to historical data.
There is high probability of poor out-of-sample performance.

Reason: Deflated Sharpe ratio is not statistically significant (p-value = 0.330585)
