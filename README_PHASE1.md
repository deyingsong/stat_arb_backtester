# High-Performance C++ Backtesting Engine
## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure - Complete

### 🎯 Overview

Phase 1 establishes the foundational architecture for a professional-grade, low-latency backtesting engine designed for statistical arbitrage strategies. This implementation follows the principles outlined in "Architecting a High-Performance C++ Backtesting Engine for Statistical Arbitrage" with a focus on:

- **Lock-free event processing** using the Disruptor pattern
- **Type-safe event system** with compile-time polymorphism
- **Modular architecture** enabling seamless transition from backtesting to live trading
- **Nanosecond-precision performance monitoring**
- **Comprehensive error handling and validation**
